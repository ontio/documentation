ONT ID establishes a cryptographic-based digital identity for any user, company, item, etc. The digital identity is based on Ontology blockchain technology and is not subject to any centralized organization. It is completely controlled by the user and is secure， trustworthy and reliable.

Once you create your ONT ID you will immediately have a blockchain-based digital identity. In order to make your ONT ID more credible, you can authenticate and endorse your ONT ID through trusted sources in different fields, such as eID, CA, governments, institutions, schools, companies, communities, individuals and so on. After being authenticated and authorized, you will then obtain blockchain certificates from different identity trust sources (we call them “verifiable claims").
