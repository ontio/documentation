Advantage：
1. Punica is the first dapp development framework for the ontology, saving users at least 50% development time.
2. Provide a large number of textbooks and videos for beginners to get started.
3. Developed a smart contract testing framework that supports unit testing and functional testing, which is much easier than using the SDK testing.
4. Smart contract compilation/deployment/testing in one command, saving development time. The debug function has been integrated in smartx, and the command line debug function is supported later.
5. solo-chain makes it easy for users to view data on the chain in real time, which is more than 50% more convenient than test net or building a private network.
6. Provide a variety of SDKs and dApi cases, suitable for different user groups to develop dApp.
