Ontology has developed a number of SDKs to help developers work with the Ontology Ecosystem across a range of languages. These SDKs include items such as encryption algorithms, RPC interaction and smart contract functions and are an important bridge for interaction between applications and the Ontology blockchain.

This official Ontology SDK is a comprehensive library for the Ontology blockchain. SDKs supports multiple functions including native wallet management, digital identity management, digital asset management, smart contract deployment and invocation and node communication

Ontology has developed a variety of SDKs, including:

* [Github of Java SDK](https://github.com/ontio/ontology-java-sdk), [API docs](https://apidoc.ont.io/javasdk/)
* [Github of Android SDK](https://github.com/ontio-community/ontology-andriod-sdk), [API docs](https://apidoc.ont.io/javasdk/)
* [Github of Typescript SDK](https://github.com/ontio/ontology-ts-sdk), [API docs](https://apidoc.ont.io/tssdk/)
* [Github of Python SDK](https://github.com/ontio/ontology-python-sdk), [API docs](https://nashmiao.github.io/ontology-python-sdk-docs/)
* [Github of Golang SDK](https://github.com/ontio/ontology-go-sdk)
* [Github of Objective-C SDK](https://github.com/ontio-community/ontology-oc-sdk)
* [Github of PHP SDK ](https://github.com/ontio-community/ontology-php-sdk)
* [Github of Kotlin SDK ](https://github.com/OntologyCommunityDevelopers/ontology-kotlin-sdk)
* [Github of Swift SDK](https://github.com/ontio-community/ontology-swift-sdk)
* [Github of csharp SDK](https://github.com/ontio-community/ontology-csharp-sdk)

In addition, several other SDKs are being developed, such as: C#, C++.

The common functions across the various SDKs are：

* Wallet file management
* Digital identity and verifable claim management
* Digital assets
* Smart contract deployment and invocation
* Basic operation of blockchain nodes
