## Getting Started

If you want to use Cocos Creator to develop blockchain games based on the ontology network, you can install the `ontology-dapi` required for the desktop browser and the `cyano-bridge` required for the mobile phone.

<p class="warning">
The <code>ontology-dapi</code> on the desktop browser cannot be used on the mobile side. Therefore, if you need multi-end adaptation, create different game scenarios for the desktop and mobile, and build them separately at build time.
</p>

### Desktop Browser

ontology-dapi is A lightweight Javascript library for interacting with Chrome Plugin which is integrated provider engine.

```bash
$ npm install @ont-dev/ontology-dapi -S
```

We can use it as ES6 module in our game scene's script.

```JavaScript
import { client, provider } from '@ont-dev/ontology-dapi';
```

We can also use it as CommonJS/ES6 module in our game scene's script.

```JavaScript
var client = require('@ont-dev/ontology-dapi').client;
```

After we regist with Provider successful, we can use it in our project.

```JavaScript
client.registerClient({
        extension: provider.ExtensionType.Cyano
  })
```

### Mobile Phone

cyano-bridge is library allows your dApp to interface with mobile wallet which is integrated provider engine.

```bash
$ npm install cyanobridge -S
```

We can use it as ES6 module in our game scene's TypeScript script.

```JavaScript
import { client } from 'cyanobridge';
```

We can also use it as CommonJS/ES6 module in our game scene's script.

```JavaScript
var client = require('cyanobridge').client;
```

After we regist with Provider successful, we can use it in our project.

```JavaScript
client.registerClient();
```
