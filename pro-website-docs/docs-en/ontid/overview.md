## What can ONT ID do for you?

ONT ID Create a cryptography-secured account powered by the Ontology blockchain for individuals, companies, and more. Use it to manage identities, digital assets, payments, and other authorizations.

ONT ID help you do these following things:

* Unified login

Use ONT ID as your sole access point to the blockchain world.

* Asset management

Storing numerous types of digital assets is a hassle. No need to worry though, with ONT ID you can access all your digital assets in one place.

* Fast payments

Link your private key with a verification method of your choice, whether that be fingerprint, Face ID, SMS verification, or another method.

* Multi-source authentication

Using Ontology’s trust partners you can access identity verification services that cover nearly 200 countries and regions, as well as use your qualifications, reputation, and credit to manage your own personal profile.

## The features of ONT ID

ONT ID has key features as below :

* Identity you can trust

By the nature of blockchain your identity cannot be tampered with by third parties, while multi-factor identities and data authentication let you compile well-rounded and credible identities.

* Data security

Privacy protection is ensured by cryptographic algorithms and your key for encryption can be self-managed or entrusted with a third party. All data access must obtain your authorization.

* Easy to use

Avoid the fuss. Keep your identity data together in one place and quickly authorize its use.

* International standards and global coverage

ONT ID is fully compatible with W3C DID standards. You are free to use your identity and data with any organization using the ONT ID protocol across the world.


## How can I integrate ONT ID?

ONT ID is open for all partners and developers , You can freely integrate ONT ID application suite .

## Work principles

Before using ONT ID, you can first get an idea of how ONT ID works.

The following roles will be present throughout the use of ONT ID:

* **Recipient** The owner of the ONT ID, they can accept verifiable claims issued by verifiers, or issue verifiable claims to others.

* **Claim issuer** This can be any ONT ID holder in the Ontology ecosystem, including Ontology trust anchors (partners providing the certification service), which may be government agencies, universities, banks, or third-party certification services (such as CA), biometric technology companies, and so on. These companies provide multi-dimensional authentication for ONT ID owners and record authentication activity and result hash, thereby reaching service demands of the user while using a standardized, trusted way to authenticate.

* **Claim verifier** Receives the user's verifiable claim and verifies the case, such as with an employer who needs to verify the interviewer's identity information/education/industry skills.

* **Developer** Provide various application development services for different users and scenarios using the ONT ID protocol and interface.

## Understanding the ONT ID protocol

The ONT ID protocol system consists of two parts: the Ontology DID and the verifiable claim protocol.

Ontology DID is a decentralized identity protocol based on [W3C](https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/) [DID](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) specification. Ontology's ONT ID creates and manage on-chain identities using this protocol.

A verifiable claim is a statement made by an entity of certain attributes of another entity (including itself). It includes the entity's own digital signature to prove the authenticity of these attributes, which can be used by other entities for verification purposes. The verifiable claim protocol details the procedures and specifications for the issuance, storage, verification, and so on of the statement. The Ontology verifiable claim protocol establishes a decentralized trust model and a distributed trust delivery system, and introduces cryptographic techniques such as the C-L signature algorithm and sigma protocol to assure privacy protection of verifiable claims.

## Why do we need to decentralize your identity?

On March 18th, 2018, US social media giant Facebook revealed that user information data of  more than 50 million users was leaked. On March 27th, Facebook CEO Zuckerberg published an article in a number of newspapers, publicly apologizing, admitting that they had hurt the trust of users. He said Facebook have a responsibility to protect your information, and if they can’t, they don't deserve it. They violated trust and are sorry that they didn't do more at the time. Of course, this scandal was only a concentrated outbreak of the problem. For the general public, Zuckerberg’s apology is merely an emotional expression. What is actually needed is to protect user data privacy through legal and technical methods, and to protect a healthy public domain network environment.
