## What is a trust anchor?

Trust anchors are partners that provide certification services in the Ontology ecosystem. They may be government agencies, universities, banks, third-party certification service organizations (such as CA), biometric technology companies, etc. These companies provide multi-dimensional authentication for ONT ID owners and record authentication activity and result hash, thereby reaching service demands of the user while using a standardized, trusted way to authenticate.
