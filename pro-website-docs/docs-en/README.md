<h3 align="center">Documentation for Ontology application products</h3>

[Ontology](https://ont.io/#/) provides a range of protocol standards. These include identity protocol, multi-source authentication protocol, user authorization protocol, distributed data exchange protocol, and more to come. Based on these protocols, Ontology provides products and frameworks for application developers in order to directly build dApps without having knowledge of how to develop a complicated distributed system. This makes getting started with blockchain development easy!

#### Our current product range include：

* ONT ID 

ONT ID can establish a cryptographic digital identity for users, organizations, objects, or any other entity type. Digital identity is based on the Ontology blockchain technology and is not restricted by any centralized organizations. The identity is self sovereign, managed by the ID holder, and has the characteristics of security and credibility.

* ONT Pass 

Based on ONT ID and the Ontology trust eco-system, ONT Pass is an open and decentralized authentication platform providing various authentication services for people, assets, objects and events.

* Decentralized Data Exchange Application Framework (DDXF)

Based on the Ontology blockchain and ONT ID protocols, DDXF implements digital asset decentralized transactions through a unified ledger, smart contracts, and cryptography. DDXF provides a range of smart contract templates, transaction components and cryptographic components. The front-end application can easily implement data collaboration and sharing.

* TrustAnchor Connector (TAConnector)

Trust anchors refers to the partners that provides authentication services in the Ontology ecosystem. Trust anchors can be government agencies, universities, banks, third-party authentication service agencies (such as CA agencies), biometric technology companies and more. They provide multi-dimensional authentication for ONT ID owners by recording the HASH of authentication behavior and authentication result on the Ontology blockchain while providing a standardized and credible authentication method for the authentication requester.

TAConnector is a technology access component that helps Trust anchors quickly access the Ontology trust ecosystem.

* More products are coming soon
