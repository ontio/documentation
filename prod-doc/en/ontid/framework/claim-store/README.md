# Claim store

`Claim store` is a place to help ONT ID users managing their claims. 

- Any ONT ID user can delegate the match-up of any of their qualified items in claims with web-app requirement to `claim store`. 
- Any web-app with potential customer qualification requirement can generate their customer requirement to `claim store` and `claim store` will match-up the requirement with qualified items of ONT ID users and notify them. ONT ID users decide whether to provide their `anonymous credential` to the app and become customer(s).
